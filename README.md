### Problem Statement - 
* An education company named *X Education* sells online courses to industry professionals.
* Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead.
* The typical lead conversion rate at *X Education* is around **30%**.
* To make the *lead conversion process* **more efficient**, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as *`Hot Leads`*.

> [!NOTE]
> **Data** -
> * Team has been provided with a leads dataset from the past with around 9000 data points. This dataset consists of various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc.
> * The target variable, in this case, is the column ‘Converted’ which tells whether a past lead was converted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Goals** -
> * Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
> * There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.
